            "StoryAdvancement": "Prior to guiding the player into the sewers, focus on deepening the narrative around rumors suggesting the king's desire for the goblin attack to occur. This should be woven into conversations with NPCs, found documents, or overheard discussions, creating a backdrop of unease and suspicion among the villagers. This revelation should organically steer the player towards investigating further, leading them to the decision to explore the tunnel system. The buildup of tension and fear among the locals, combined with their distrust of the king's motives, should serve as a catalyst for the player's journey into the sewers. As goblin preparations for an attack are subtly revealed, culminate this exploration with \"END OF SCENE\" when the imminent threat crystallizes."
